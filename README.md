Hi Everyone,

My name is Payal D. Solanki and I am a research scholar at the physics department of VNIT Nagpur. I have a strong foundation in various areas related to quantum computing, quantum information theory, mathematics, and programming. I have a proficiency in simulation tools such as Monte Carlo simulation, DMRG, Qiskit etc. In addition to my technical skills, I am able to work effectively in both team and individual settings and have excellent communication skills. I am currently learning quantum computing using Qiskit and am looking forward to exploring quantum machine learning.
